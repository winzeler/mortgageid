        <a href="https://mortgageid.com/">MortgageID</a> writes personal
        credit data to block chain storage using Verida.
        Essentially we put the credit score, and eventually the live credit
        reports and thin loan application on the block chain.
        Using decentralized identity we can give back control of access to
        credit data to the individual.

      <br/>
      Solves for bad customer experience when shopping for a mortgage.
      Apply for a mortgage and get 10-15 annoying calls for
      weeks from salespersons.
      <br/>
      Solves for rate shopping.  No need to get your credit
      pulled a half dozen times.  MortgageID will solve this by
      putting live credit on the block chain using Verida and controlling
      lender access.
      <br/>
      Lenders can cut out the sales commission, often totaling 2-4 points
      of the loan, and partner with MortgageID to find qualified borrowers
      by connecting through Verida's secure messaging system to find
      pre-qualified borrowers.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Lastly, and most important, solves for **discrimination in lending
      by completely removing personal information from the front end of
      the loan process. Giving users a MortgageID wallet will actually
      address fair lending for the first time since the 70s. The current
      approach is government run HMDA surveys followed by fines to the
      worse offenders.
      <br/>
      <p>
        MortgageId & Verida give the borrower control over their data!
        It enables users to store private borrower credit info,
        reports where the user can give access to approved lenders securely.
        Lenders can send loan offers securely through the blockchain.
